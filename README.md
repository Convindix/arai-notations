Here is a collection of useful small blobs of code. They aren't so small, standalone, and disorganized that they would fit comfortably in a Gist. Yet they are also too small to sensibly get their own repositories. Here they are roughly categorized and sorted into folders by purpose and function.

Given the structure of the code blobs here, there isn't really any maintained standard for them. Take and use what you need. I hope even the jankier programs in here are useful to someone.
